Working across the wide range of quite-different GNU/Linux distributions shall be a big challenge. There is no standard ABI, and distributions present installed packages and libraries in different ways. However, when we consider that we need-not consult the distribution package manager - we can probe for difinitive information off the _file-system_ and also that we shall often be able to compile the package on the user's _own_ system for itself, these problems take a very solvable appearance - that's what we need all problems we encounter to do (it can be done).
